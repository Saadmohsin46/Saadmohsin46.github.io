journal entry
1.Terminal is a tool that you can use to add stuff in any place in your computer.
vim is a tool that you can use to add files in your website.
git is a website.
2.It's pretty incredible how these tools work and what they can do.
3.this is really easy stuff in the  start you might not understand anything but as you go through stuff you'll start understanding and everything will be easy to do.  
4. In my previous math classes I learned about Slope Intercept,point-slope and  standard form and domain and range.This is what i learned about these topics:
1. Domain and range identify all possible inputs and outputs of a function.
2. The slope intercept form of a line is given by y=mx+b,where m represents the 
slope and b represents the y intercept.
3. point slope form is expressed as y-y1=(x-x1) is used to write the equation of a line when point on the line and the slope are known.
4. The standard form of a line is written as Ax+by=c,and it's useful for certaintypes of algebric manipulations.
5. Understanding the domain helps you determine the set of all possible x-values that can be plugged into a function.
6. The range is the set of all possible y-values that can come out of a function7. Each of these forms is a different way to describe and understand linear equations.
